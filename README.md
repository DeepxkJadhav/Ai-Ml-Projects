# 🧠 AI & ML Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** projects portfolio !  
This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects I've built using AI/ML concepts, frameworks, and tools. Each project explores different techniques, use-cases, and real-world applications in the field.

## 🔍 About This Repository

This repo serves as a central place for:

- Practicing and experimenting with machine learning and deep learning algorithms
- Exploring real-world datasets and solving meaningful problems
- Documenting end-to-end AI solutions: data → model → deployment
- Showcasing personal learning, creativity, and growth in AI/ML
